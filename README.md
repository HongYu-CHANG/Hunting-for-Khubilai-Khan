# Hunting for Khubilai Khan

## Synopsis
"Hunting for Khubilai Khan" is a virtual reality game inspired by Khubilai Khan Hunting and Ayusi Scattering Rebels with Upraised Spear, which features the experience of actual hunting and shooting. Players are able to sense the reaction of the bowstring when shooting with the bow installation, and also control the velocity of their ride with the upper leg pressure sensor when simulating the action of horse-riding.

The player must hunt down different wild animals for Khubilai Khan, including rabbits, wolves, deer, geese, etc., and accumulate points according to the number of their catch in order to claim their reward from the great Khan. This virtual reality horseback game integrates the renowned painting of Khubilai Khan Hunting, recreating the experience of the Yuan dynasty horseback hunters and how they displayed gallantry with bow and arrow while galloping across the boundless northern deserts in the golden era of hunting.
